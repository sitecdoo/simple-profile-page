# Simple profile page

## Tech stack

Your task is to create a simple one-page profile website using the following techstack:
- Astro web framework [https://astro.build/](https://astro.build/)
- Tailwind CSS: [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Git for version control (create a repo on github.com and commit all code there, or fork and modify one of the sample projects - see below)
- If you decide to add a blog page, or simplify future content updates, consider using [Markdown and MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/)
- If you decide to use any interactive elements (e.g. simple contact form or newsletter subscription form), we recommend using Shadcn/UI: [https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/authentication](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/authentication) (this is the main page, but there are also ports for othen popular FE frameworks such as Svelte or Vue)
- If you have any content that you need to reuse multiple times (e.g. resume sections), put it into reusable Astro components [https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/).
- Finally, consider publishing/deploying your website on [Netlify or Vercel](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/)
